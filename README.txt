TIMESTAMPS_COMPRESSION

The Timestamps are converted into seconds and the delta between current and previous one is compressed using variable length encoding. 

Varint Encoding : For any byte in the stream of bytes generated by MSB, the most significant bitis set only if there is a next byte in
the stream. 

0xxxxxxx                     7 bits in 1 byte
1xxxxxxx 0xxxxxxx           14 bits in 2 bytes
1xxxxxxx 1xxxxxxx 0xxxxxxx  21 bits in 3 bytes
...


Input file size : Timestamps.txt -- 7,932KB
Encoded file size: Encoded.bin -- 717KB

 Degree of Compression = ((Size of encoded file in bytes)/(Number of timestamps))*8
                       =  (((717*1000)/451210)*8) = 12.71

Running Code on Windows :
1) I have used Dev C++ compiler
2) While compiling make sure you set the Build option to get all input and executable file in same folder. Method given below:
 Project --> Project Options --> Build options --> Set Executable directory to current folder

Running Code on Ubuntu :

Compile:
"gcc timestamp_compression.c -o timestamp"
Execute :
./timestamp
